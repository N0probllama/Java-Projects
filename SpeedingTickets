 * Speeing Tickets
 * September 19th - 22nd, 2022.
 * 
 * This program uses boolean operatiors and nesting If/Else statments to calculate fines for drivers 
 * who are non-compliant with driving laws.
 * 
 * This project is designed to allow users to input driving data to calculate driving fines.
 * Fines are calculated using the driver's speed, the posted speed limit of the driving location and whether the 
 * driving location is within a school zone or construction zone. 
 * Fines are also calculated for those who drive 20km/hr below the posted speed limit.
